    ----------
    im : ndarray
        2D image that will have grid tag lines applied
    spacing : float
        The distance between lines, in pixels
    total_flip : float, optional
        The total RF flip (degrees) of the tagging pulse, by default 70
        A higher number here, up to 90, will make the dark regions of the tag lines
        darker, with 90 being complete nulling.
    flip_pattern : tuple or ndarray, optional
        The type of tagging pulse to play, by default (1, 3, 3, 1)
        Splitting the tagging pulse into a binomial pulse makes the tag lines
        sharper, other options would be (1, 1) which would give broad lines, and
        (1, 4, 6, 4, 1) for even sharper lines
    x_offset : float, optional
        Offsets the line pattern in the x direction, in pixels, by default 0
